      <h1>The MultiSensor Icon Editor</h1>

      <p>A MultiSensor Icon lets you display one of N icons, 
        depending on which one of N associated sensors is active.
        For example, you could have three icons displaying the three positions of
        a CTC lever; see image below.  But it doesn't have to be three.  
        For example, you could have ten icons representing the positions of a
        thumbwheel switch.</p>
      <p>The user can move to the next or previous icon by
        clicking on the icon as described below.  This will deactivate the current sensor
        and activate the newly-selected one.</p>
       <p>People often use this in concert with
        <a href="../sensorgroup/SensorGroupFrame.shtml">Sensor Groups</a> to make sure that the
        layout can only activate one sensor.</p>
        

      <p>The way icons are changed in the MultiSensor Icon Editor is the same as they are changed
      in the other Icon Editors. The <strong>Change Icon...</strong>button and the Catalog function
      identically with other Icon Editors.<br>
      The <strong>Find Icons</strong> menu and its items are also identical.</p>

      <p>See the <a href="IconAdder.shtml">Icon Editors page</a> and the <a href=
      "../catalog/ImageIndex.shtml">Image Index Editor page</a> for details on their use.</p>

      <h2>Contents of the MultiSensor Icon Editor</h2>

      <p>The icons in the MultiSensor Icon Editor differ only from other Icon Editors
      in that there are several "active"
      icons. Each corresponds to e.g. a switch or lever position or some other 
      sequence of icons.
      On the Panel that's using the icon, the positions can be cycled
      through in sequence in either forward or reverse order.
            
      <p>A position can be deleted by pressing the <strong>Delete</strong> button
      under the icon. Additional positions can be added by pressing the <strong>Add another
      Icon</strong> button.</p>

      <p>Each active icon must have a sensor associated with it. To assign a sensor to an icon
      position, drag a row from the Sensor table to the place in the icon position pane labeled
      "undefined". When the sensor row is dropped on the label, it will display the sensor
      name.</p>

      <p>The 
      <strong>Up &lt;-&gt; Down</strong>
      and 
      <strong>Right &lt;-&gt; Left </strong>
      radio buttons determine where the user clicks to 
      go to the next or previous sensor icon.  If 
      <strong>Up &lt;-&gt; Down</strong>
      is selected, clicking in the 
      top half will advance the selection.  If 
      <strong>Right &lt;-&gt; Left</strong>
      is selected, clicking in the 
      right half will advance the selection.
      Note that this works best when all the images are the same size.
      It can be difficult to properly click on the icons if they vary in size.</p>
      
      <p>When all the active icons are assigned sensors, the <strong>Add to Panel</strong> button
      will become active and it can be pressed to install the MultiSensor onto the Panel.</p>
