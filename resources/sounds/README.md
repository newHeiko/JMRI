Dick Bronson contributed the following files:
  They are taken from the machine in the NC Transportation 
  museum where there was a lot of background hum from lights, etc. 
  I have taken that out, but the resulting quality is not what 
  I would have preferred. Probably for the clicks on a panel they 
  will be fine, because they will be in response to mouse clicks.
